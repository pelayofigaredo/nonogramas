# nonogramas
A small game done using windows forms during my first year of uni.

It includes more than 30 different nonograms of different sizes. Inside this nonogram the player must guess which of the cells are part of the drawing and which are not by using the information provided. The drawings are readed from .txt during execution. After committing a number of mistakes dependant of the size the user is forced to restart the puzzle.
